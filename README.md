# ML-model-to-detect-illegal-activities-in-a-forest-
For the SPARK project our team has decided to implement a device which can detect illegal sounds at forest and send the signals to relevant authorities.

## FSC- 22 Data Set
  ### XGB MODEL
    - Augmented the data set by pitching up and Down by  2 steps
    - Used MFCC for feature extraction
    - Achieved 71% accuracy 
  ### CNN MODEL
    - Used Mel Spectrogram for feature extraction
    - Used 7 layer Conv2d, 2 layer Maxpolling2D, 2 layer Dense
